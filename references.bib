        abstract = {Drawing distinct units without replacement and with unequal probabilities from a population is a problem often considered in the literature (e.g. , Int. Statist. Rev. 48, 317-355). In such a case, the sample mean is a biased estimator of the population mean. For this reason, we use the unbiased Horvitz-Thompson estimator (1951). In this work, we focus our interest on the variance of this estimator. The variance is cumbersome to compute because it requires the calculation of a large number of second-order inclusion probabilities. It would be helpful to use an approximation that does not need heavy calculations. The a \&amp;unknown; jek (1964)\&gt; variance approximation provides this advantage as it is free of second-order inclusion probabilities. a \&amp;unknown; jek (1964)\&gt; proved that this approximation is valid under restrictive conditions that are usually not fulfilled in practice. In this paper, we give more general conditions and we show that this approximation remains acceptable for most practical problems.}

abstract = {The well-known problem of unequal probability sampling of fixed size from a finite population can be generalised in a partitioning problem of a population into subsets, having unequal inlcusion probabilities in each subset. A simple algorithm that allows one to solve this problem is presented. The random partition of a population can be used to easily solve questions related to sample coordination in repeated sample surveys: the management of the overlap and the rotation. An application is developed where the maximal overlap of two samples selected with unequal probabilities is reached. Nevertheless, this method has an inconvenience: the samples must be selected at the same time. In order to overcome this difficulty, another method based on the multi-phase sampling method is also proposed.}
